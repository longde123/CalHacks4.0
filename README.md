# CalHacks4.0
Created a Kinect Fire Painting app: trying to experiment with projection art

Ended up diverging from “interactive projection mapping”
To just standard kinect interaction/game. 

Cal hacks:


Tasks:
	-Problem 1: getting kinect up on mac
	-Problem 2: getting kinect examples working on mac
	-Problem 3: figuring out kinect examples, sdk, depth, etc, establish extent of interactivity
	-Passing depth stuff to a c++ program:	
		-
	-Problem 3: getting fluid simulation examples working on mac


Option1: 
	-Interactive projection mapping 
	-Control system (IR)
		-Kinect 
		-leap motion
Technical options:
	-Kinect SDK + c++ and open frameworks
	-Kinect with Unity
	-Kinect with Unreal
Installation:
	-OpenNI

Operating systems:
	-OSX
	-Windows
	-Linux

Option 2:
	-Interactive projection mapping 
	-Control system 
		-(based on computer vision/cameras)

If Comp-vision:
	-Augment peoples shadows

If kinect tracking:
Interacting with things on a screen:
	-Be able to knock around letters on a powerpoint
		-“You fucked up my screen!”
	-Interact with a undulating mesh
	-Interact with flowing fluids (harder cuz you have to simulate)
